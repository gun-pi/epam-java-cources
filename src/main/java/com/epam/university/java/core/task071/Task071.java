     * You are a very nice programmer and a really helpful friend.
     * That's why you decided to make a small present for your friend.
     * So now your problem to solve is how to implement a program
     * that will find periods between two dates in time units a user needs.
     *
     * Format of date is: YYYY-mm-dd
     * Tip: bank system is not the easiest thing to understand
     * so your friend gave some templates of dates and queries.
     * (Look right in the test examples)
     *

     * @param dates        two dates between which
     *                     you need to find period
     * @return a list of date introducing period type
